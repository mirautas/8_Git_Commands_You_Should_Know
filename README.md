8 Git Commands You Should Know

If youâ€™re a software developer, you probably already know that Git is one of the most useful version control systems out there. But while most developers have mastered the basics of Git, it can be a bit harder to take your skills to the next level and become an advanced Git user. In this course, instructor Ronnie Sheer shows you how to make the move from intermediate Git developer to the realm of finely tuned, source control expert.

Learn eight power-user Git commands that can save you time, prevent bugs, and more. Find out how to increase your productivity as well as minimize your moments of frustration. Ronnie walks you through a few basic tricks like stashing and adding changes, and then turns to more advanced techniques, such as undoing commits, reverting, and setting up precommit hooks. Test out your new skills with Git-command challenges along the way.
